  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Nice to meet you, I'm Julia. The youngest of four Devine children, I am a Seattleite living just a few blocks away from the Space Needle.<br>
  A competitive ballroom dancer for now 10 years, I have won three national titles. Whenever I'm not dancing, you will likely find me playing piano, cooking with my family, or outside taking photos of my surroundings. </p>
