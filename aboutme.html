  <p>Conditional- If a certain statement is true, perform a certain action. If not, perform some other specified action.<br>
    analogy: If the light is green, go. If not, stop.<br>

    My idea of robotics didn't really change, even after our discussions in class. I'm excited that robots<br>
    can help us in our day-to-day life and help us discover answers to difficult questions. What<br>
    makes me nervous is the possibility that robots may one day become independent from humans<br>
    and that they may start to become a hindrance to the human race.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    When I was working on circuits in my group, we hit a lot of avoidable roadblocks. The problem is that we<br>
    didn't have an arduino that came with all of the necessary batteries. Our first few circuit configurations<br>
    would've worked, but nothing happened until we received an additional battery. When we were confused<br>
    or lost, we asked for help. We also utilized different video tutorials and used those as a<br>
    template for our circuit. Next time, I'll make sure that everything is set up properly before<br>
    my group dives in to the challenge.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard are both women who programmed robots to carry out advanced functions. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    On the light show challenge, I worked on the pseudo code and some general mechanics on the circuit board, Seble<br>
    researched tutorials and communicated with other groups, and Jolie placed items on the board and<br>
    wrote the final draft of the code that was uploaded to the arduino. I could've helped Jolie more with<br>
    translating my pseudo code into the code that was on the arduino program.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Every arduino sketch has comments, variables, and functions. Functions include pinMode(), digitalWrite(),<br>
    setup(), loop(), and delay().<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Today I learned how complex circuits can be if not set up properly.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    My favorite part of my group's robot's dance is that it rotated when Rihanna sang "round and around and<br>
    around and around we go". Also, the noise that we initially programmed our piezo to make was hilarious!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both had robots whose outputs were sound and movement.<br>
